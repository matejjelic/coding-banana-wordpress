<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design pattern challenge</span></h1>
Designing object-oriented software is hard enough, but designing <strong>reusable</strong> object-oriented software is even harder. But to make our lives easier, the <strong>Design Patterns</strong> were “invented”.
There are many design patterns and each of them is specific to the problem, but also general enough to address requirements and problems in the future. They also take chances of re-designing everything over and over again to a minimum.
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the Design Patterns?</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A successful designs and architectures are reused by implementing various design patterns. Design patterns make those successful designs and architectures easily accessible to developers. </span>
<blockquote><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design patterns help you choose design alternatives that make a system </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reusable and avoid alternatives that compromise reusability. Design patterns can even </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">improve the documentation and maintenance of existing systems by furnishing an </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">explicit specification of class and object interactions and their underlying intent.</span></i></blockquote>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Gang of Four - Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software)</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many points of view what design patterns are. Here, only <strong>23 of them</strong> will be covered and they are not covering any patterns in real-time programming, distributed programming, concurrency, UI, object-oriented databases, writing of drivers, etc. Also, these design patterns will be covered throughout the Java programming language. This does not mean that they are applicable only to Java, but to practically any object-oriented language.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three groups of design patterns will be covered, and those groups are consisted of the following patterns:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Creational design patterns</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Singleton Pattern</li>
 	<li>Abstract Factory Pattern</li>
 	<li>Prototype Pattern</li>
 	<li>Factory Method Pattern</li>
 	<li>Builder Pattern</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Structural design patterns</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Proxy Pattern</li>
 	<li>Flyweight Pattern</li>
 	<li>Bridge Pattern</li>
 	<li>Facade Pattern</li>
 	<li>Decorator Pattern</li>
 	<li>Adapter Pattern</li>
 	<li>Composite Pattern</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Behavioural design patterns</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Observer Pattern</li>
 	<li>Template Method Pattern</li>
 	<li>Command Pattern</li>
 	<li>Iterator Pattern</li>
 	<li>State Pattern</li>
 	<li>Mediator Pattern</li>
 	<li>Strategy Pattern</li>
 	<li>Chain of Responsibility Pattern</li>
 	<li>Visitor Pattern</li>
 	<li>Interpreter Pattern</li>
 	<li>Memento Pattern</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creational design patterns mainly deal with the instantiation process. Here we make the systems independent from how their objects are created, collected, or represented.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural design patterns focus on how objects and classes are associated or can be composed to make relatively large structures. Inheritance mechanisms are mostly used to combine interfaces or implementations.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Behavioural design patterns concentrate on algorithms and the assignment of the critical </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">responsibilities among the objects. We also need to focus on the communication </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">between them. We need to take a closer look at the way those objects are i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nterconnected.</span>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next steps</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each design pattern will be explained separately in further posts.

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">See you on the next post where we will cover the <strong>Observer Pattern</strong>.</span>
