<h1>Introduction</h1>
This whole thing is a wild and expensive idea, but I decided to do it anyways. But let me first tell you how and why I got to this idea.

I am a happy owner of WLtoys A979 car. It is an older model with brushed motor. I got it for my birthday from my brother a few years ago, and it's awesome! Over the course of time, I started upgrading some parts. Some of them where upgraded out of the mere need, and some just for fun.
<h1>My upgrading history</h1>
<em>Stupidity #1: Don't be lazy (like me) and always have a proper toolkit for replacing or repairing your car...</em>
<h2>So... the parts... and history</h2>
<h3>Rear left wheel seat</h3>
The first upgrade I did was the rear left wheel seat. After not that high jump in a skate-park, the seat simply broke in half. I decided to replace it with a metal part, so I ended up buying two rear seats.
<h3>Battery</h3>
Later on, the car ran just fine - but the runtime was always short. So I decided to upgrade the battery too. After a saga of ordering where all my LiPo battery orders from overseas were rejected due to EU regulations, I finally screwed up by buying a <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/zippy-compact-5000mah-2s-25c-lipo-pack.html?___store=en_us">too powerful battery from Hobbyking</a>. The battery was too large, the plug was incompatible, the discharge rate was high too (25 C) and I am not sure about the amount of current (A), but it was probably larger it should have been. How do I know? Well... I soldered the JST plug to my battery, but then it burned my ESC/Receiver.
<h3>ESC/Receiver</h3>
So, I had to order another ESC/Receiver, but the original one was... too weak? So I went with the one with a Deans T-plug (from WLtoys A9*9-<strong>B</strong> series). Luckily, it worked fine with both the battery and the transmitter.
<h3>Wheels</h3>
While waiting for my new ESC to arrive, I accidentally ordered the 12mm hex adapter for wheels (I thought it was the original one - 8mm), so I ordered a new set of wheels as well.

With the new ESC, battery, and set of wheels the car was absolutely amazing to drive. The story goes on...
<h3>Rear left transmission shaft and motor</h3>
Some days ago, my rear transmission shaft fell out of the car somehow. I think the screw that held the rear rod was too loose. I lost the transmission shaft, so I thought I'll just order another one. In the meantime, the car was still operable and in a driving condition, only with front wheels. I really enjoyed the FWD RC car. But then, the car stopped. I was pushing my trigger on my transmitter, and I noticed a smoke coming out of my motor. I figured I got it burned out, because I was really pushing the car to its limits. And with the new battery, I was driving it way longer than with the stock battery.
<h2>Buy buy buy</h2>
So I figured... transmission shaft + new motor... hmmm... I might go with the new ball bearings too. Why not replace the shocks too? How about replacing the front wheel seats? And the wishlist went on and on...

And that's when I said to myself - I'll go with a full metal upgrade with this car. As my motor was burned out, buying a new brushed one seemed like a stupid idea. So, I wanted to go brushless too. And that implied the new receiver, which implied the new servo as well as the new transmitter. Even though that's expensive, I was still up for it. So, I went Googling to see what parts do I need and where can I get them from.

The journey begins...

<em>Stupidity #2: later on I discovered that my motor was actually fine, I just got some fine gravel stuck between the gears... and I already bought all the metal parts xD</em>
<h1>The birth of the decision to build a car from scratch</h1>
So, I ordered a bunch of parts. But what to do with the old parts? My old motor was functional, and a new one would put it out of use. Same goes for the original transmitter, ESC/receiver, and servo. With these things in mind, I decided to build a new car with metal parts and custom ESC, receiver, transmitter, servo, and brushless motor, and leave the old parts in the current car.

I did some mistakes ordering some parts as well. For example, I could have ordered more complete metal sets. But that's fine, I'll manage it all.
